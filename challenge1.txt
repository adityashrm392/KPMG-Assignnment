Here is an example of a 3-tier environment steps using Terraform on Azure:

1. Network Tier:
- Virtual Network (VNet): Creates a virtual network that will be used to separate the different tiers.
- Subnets: Creates three subnets within the virtual network, one for each tier.
- Network Security Groups (NSGs): Creates three NSGs, one for each tier, to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- Network Interfaces: Creates network interfaces for each of the virtual machines in the web and application tiers.
- Public IP Addresses: Creates a public IP address for the load balancer in the web tier.

2. Web Tier:
- Virtual Machines: Creates multiple virtual machines running a web server, each assigned a network interface and public IP address.
- Load Balancer: Configures a load balancer to distribute traffic across the web servers.

3. Application Tier:
- Virtual Machines: Creates multiple virtual machines running an application server, each assigned a network interface.
- Application Load Balancer: Configures an application load balancer to distribute traffic across the application servers.

4. Database Tier:
- Azure Database for MySQL: Creates an Azure Database for MySQL server to be used as the database for the application.
- Firewall Rule: Configures a firewall rule to

NOTE: Network Tier could change depends on the requirement, We could implement few more things as per the need of the client to make Infra highly available.
